changes on CTC loss function
# build on top of current
- onset CTC (add separate network, good for training, quick backpropagate, add additinoal feature)
- (feedback) CTC transducer (additinoal feature, assume at different time are conditionally dependent)
- RNN only CTC (remove CNN layers)

# rewrite loss function
- dis-attention CTC (remove duplication, so no post-process is needed)
- attention CTC (might have learn a language model). Problem attention size is changing

1. onset and frame: encoder and decode attention
2. onset and frame: highway gate
